# TargetHackthon

Welcome to MyBullseye, a product designed for a more user-friendly experience on Target.com made at the Target Women in Technnology Symposium, May 2017.

With MyBullseye, a guest can add a personalized Bullseye that will help the guest shop smarter. The guest can enter in their stats (measurements, gender, age, ect) to create a custom Bullseye. Their Bullseye will suggest recommendations for the guest, which can help the guest find clothes that match their style, faster. 
This premise then extends to allow a user to add other members of their family to achieve a more customizable shopping experience.
